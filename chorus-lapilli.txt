1. First removed jumpTo function and list of "goto move #"
Created function restartGame which resets const vars to original state
	called when "RESTART GAME" button is clicked

2. Add param moveNum to Board, updated and handled in Game()
   set to currentMove

3. Add condition in handlePlay (moveNum < 6)
   play like regular tic tac toe

4. ELSE (chorus-lapilli rules)
a. make var squareSelected (for now on we need player to make two clicks to move. also make var selectedSquare to keep track of first selection
b. first check is squareSelected is true
c. if False:
   user must click on own piece, once they select a non-null piece:
   	set squareSelected = true, selectedSquare = i

d. if True (on second click):
   next selection depends on middle square, check to see if user owns middle
   first check that new selection is adjacent to old selection in isAdjacent(i, j) //not written yet
   if player owns middle:
      check that they either:
      vacate square or WIN

e. In order to check that they win, make copy of nextSquares, update it as if they did move, now plug copy into calculateWinner

f. After handing everything, set nextSquares[selectedSquare] = null since we moved off of it
   set nextSquares[i] = currentPiece

5. isAdjacent(i, j) returns true if i and j are adjacent
hard coded, no real shortcuts (recall board looks like):

0 | 1 | 2
---------
3 | 4 | 5
---------
6 | 7 | 8

so isAdjacent(0,3)=isAdjacent(4,5) = true
but isAdjacent(2,3) = false


Overall: How To Play
First 6 moves - same as tic tac toe
After 6th move, click on piece you want to move, then click on an adjacent square where you want to move that piece.
If invalid move, click a new piece to move then click a valid adjacent space!
Game continues until one player gets three pieces in a row!
